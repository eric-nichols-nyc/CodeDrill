# Architecture Context

## Environments

| Environment | Next app (`apps/app`) | Practice API (`apps/api`) |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Local dev   | `http://localhost:3010` | `http://localhost:3030` (`NEON_JWT_API_URL`) |
| Deployed API (Render) | Set `NEON_JWT_API_URL` in host env | e.g. `https://nestjs-backend-vxu2.onrender.com` |

Deploy steps, env vars, and optional free-tier keep-alive ping: **`apps/api/README.md`** (Deploy section). Auth env (`BETTER_AUTH_URL`, trusted origins) must use the same API public URL.

## Stack

| Layer     | Technology                  | Role   |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------ |
| Framework | [e.g. Next.js + TypeScript] | [Role] |
| UI        | [e.g. Tailwind + shadcn/ui] | [Role] |
| Auth      | [e.g. Clerk]                | [Role] |
| Database  | [e.g. Prisma + PostgreSQL]  | [Role] |
| [Layer]   | [Technology]                | [Role] |

## System Boundaries

- `[folder]` — [What this folder owns and is responsible for]
- `[folder]` — [What this folder owns and is responsible for]
- `[folder]` — [What this folder owns and is responsible for]
- `[folder]` — [What this folder owns and is responsible for]

## Storage Model

- **[Storage type e.g. Database]**: [What lives here —
  e.g. metadata, ownership, relationships]
- **[Storage type e.g. Blob/File Storage]**: [What lives
  here — e.g. generated files, media, large artifacts]

## Auth and Access Model

- [How authentication works — e.g. Every user signs in
  via Clerk]
- [How ownership works — e.g. Every project has a single
  owner]
- [How access control works — e.g. Only the owner or a
  collaborator can mutate project resources]

## Invariants

1. [Rule the codebase must never violate — e.g. Request
   handlers do not run long-lived background work]
2. [Invariant two]
3. [Invariant three]
4. [Invariant four]
